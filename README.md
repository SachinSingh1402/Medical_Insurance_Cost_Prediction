# Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the cost of medical insurance based on various features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict insurance costs, which can help insurance companies and policyholders understand the factors affecting insurance premiums.

## Objectives
- To explore and preprocess the medical insurance dataset.
- To visualize the relationships between the features and the insurance cost.
- To build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict insurance costs.
- To select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains the following columns:

- age: Age of the primary beneficiary.
- sex: Gender of the beneficiary (male/female).
- bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of the body weight relative to height.
- children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- smoker: Smoking status of the beneficiary (yes/no).
- region: Residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

## You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the dataset file insurance.csv.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- models/: Serialized machine learning models.
- README.md: Project documentation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-cost-prediction.git
cd insurance-cost-prediction
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data, preprocess it, build models, and evaluate their performance.

## Steps
1. Data Exploration
- Load the dataset and explore the basic statistics.
- Visualize the distribution of features and their relationships with the insurance cost.
- Visualization techniques such as histograms, bar plots, and pair plots are used for this purpose.

2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves:

- Handling missing values (if any).
- Encoding categorical variables (sex, smoker, region).
- Normalizing numerical features (age, bmi).
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Model Training 
- Build and train various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Compare the performance of different models and select the best one

5. Prediction:
- Use the best model to make predictions on new data

## Results
The performance of each model is compared, and the best-performing model is identified. Insights and findings from the project are discussed.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict medical insurance costs. The best-performing model can be used to make predictions on new data.

## Future Work
Possible improvements and future work include:

Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
Using more advanced algorithms like XGBoost or neural networks.
Incorporating additional features for better predictions.
